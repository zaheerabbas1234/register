Exercise 3:
Module name : DevOps adoption in projects
It is important to comprehend the need to automate the software development lifecycle stages through
DevOps. Gain an understanding of the capabilities required to implement DevOps, continuous integration
and continuous delivery practices. 

 Understanding how to automate the software development lifecycle (SDLC) through DevOps is crucial for enhancing efficiency and delivering high-quality software. Here’s a breakdown of the key concepts and capabilities required for implementing DevOps practices like Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD):

### Importance of Automating the SDLC with DevOps

1. **Faster Time to Market**: Automation allows for quicker releases, enabling teams to deliver features and fixes to users more rapidly.

2. **Increased Collaboration**: DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams, reducing silos and improving communication.

3. **Higher Quality**: Automated testing and deployment practices reduce human error, leading to more reliable software.

4. **Scalability**: Automation helps teams scale processes and manage increasing workloads efficiently.

### Key Capabilities for Implementing DevOps

1. **Version Control Systems**:
   - Use tools like Git to track changes, manage code versions, and collaborate on codebases.

2. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
   - Automatically build and test code changes as soon as they are committed. This involves:
     - **Automated Testing**: Run unit, integration, and functional tests to ensure code quality.
     - **Build Automation**: Tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, or Travis CI can automate the build process.

3. **Continuous Delivery (CD)**:
   - Extend CI practices to automate the deployment process, ensuring that code can be released to production at any time. This includes:
     - **Automated Deployment**: Use tools like Kubernetes, Docker, or AWS CodeDeploy to facilitate seamless deployments.
     - **Environment Management**: Ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or Ansible.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implement monitoring tools (like Prometheus, Grafana) and logging solutions (like ELK Stack) to gain insights into application performance and detect issues early.

5. **Configuration Management**:
   - Use tools like Chef, Puppet, or Ansible to manage server configurations and ensure environments are set up correctly and consistently.

6. **Collaboration and Communication Tools**:
   - Implement tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Jira to enhance communication among team members and track project progress.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 8: 
------------------------
Module name: Implementation of CICD with Java and open source stack 
Configure the Jenkins pipeline to call the build script jobs and configure to run it whenever there is a 
change made to an application in the version control system. Make a change to the background color of the 
landing page of the web application and check if the configured pipeline runs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To configure a Jenkins pipeline to call the build script jobs and run automatically upon changes in the version control system (VCS), follow these steps:

Step 1: Configure the Jenkins Pipeline
Create a Pipeline Job

Go to the Jenkins dashboard, click on New Item.
Select Pipeline, name it (e.g., my-web-app-pipeline), and click OK.
Set Up the Pipeline Script

In the pipeline configuration, choose Pipeline script from SCM.
Select Git as the SCM and enter the repository URL.
Add your credentials if needed.
Specify the branch you want Jenkins to monitor (e.g., main or master).
Set the Script Path to the location of your Jenkinsfile (default is Jenkinsfile).
Example Jenkinsfile Configuration Ensure your Jenkinsfile includes the build steps:

groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        JAVA_HOME = tool name: 'JDK 1.8'
        MAVEN_HOME = tool name: 'Maven 3.x'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') { steps { git 'https://github.com/your-repo.git' } }
        stage('Build') { steps { sh "${MAVEN_HOME}/bin/mvn clean install" } }
        stage('Static Analysis') { steps { withSonarQubeEnv('SonarQubeServer') { sh "${MAVEN_HOME}/bin/mvn sonar:sonar" } } }
        stage('Test') { steps { sh "${MAVEN_HOME}/bin/mvn test" } }
        stage('Deploy') { steps { sh "${MAVEN_HOME}/bin/mvn tomcat7:deploy" } }
    }
    post { always { cleanWs() } }
}
Step 2: Enable Polling for Changes
In the pipeline job configuration, scroll down to the Build Triggers section.
Check the box for Poll SCM.
Set the polling schedule using cron syntax (e.g., H/5 * * * * to poll every 5 minutes).
Example schedule:
Copy code
H/5 * * * *
This configuration tells Jenkins to check for changes in the repository every 5 minutes.
Step 3: Make Changes to the Application
Modify the Background Color
Open your landing page file (e.g., index.html or your main JSP file).
Change the background color in your CSS or HTML. For example:
css
Copy code
body {
    background-color: lightblue; /* Change to your desired color */
}
Commit and Push Changes
Commit your changes with a message:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Change background color of the landing page"
git push origin main  # Replace with your branch name if different
Step 4: Verify the Jenkins Pipeline Execution
After pushing the changes, wait for Jenkins to poll the repository based on the schedule you set.
Navigate to your Jenkins job (e.g., my-web-app-pipeline) in the Jenkins dashboard.
Check the Build History to see if a new build has started automatically.
Click on the latest build to view the logs and ensure that the build, test, and deploy stages were executed successfully.
Step 5: Check the Application Deployment
Access your web application deployed on Tomcat to confirm the background color change.
Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where your application is deployed (e.g., http://localhost:8080/my-web-app).
Summary
You’ve configured a Jenkins pipeline to build, test, and deploy your application automatically whenever there are changes in the version control system.
After modifying the background color and pushing the changes, Jenkins should run the pipeline according to the polling configuration, confirming that the setup works correctly.
